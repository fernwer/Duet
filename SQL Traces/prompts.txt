Group 1: Entity Drill-Down (High Frequency Point Queries)
Context:
You are simulating the backend log of a Customer Support Chatbot. The chatbot receives thousands of specific inquiries about individual entities in the TPC-H database (Customers, Orders, Parts).

Task:
Generate 3000 distinct SQL queries that represent the chatbot retrieving details for specific IDs.
- The chatbot needs to look up phone numbers, current statuses, or balances for single entities based on their ID.
- The requests are simple but urgent.

Constraint:
- Do NOT use specific SQL instructions. Just translate the intent "Find info for ID X" into SQL.
- Use random IDs appropriate for TPC-H scale.
- Return ONLY the raw SQL, one per line.

Group 2: Multi-Criteria Screening (Batch/Range Queries)
Context:
You are simulating the query stream generated by a "Dashboard Filter" UI used by regional managers. The dashboard allows users to select multiple criteria to slice and dice the TPC-H data.

Task:
Generate 3000 distinct SQL queries representing users applying filters on the dashboard.
- Users might check multiple boxes for 'Market Segment' or 'Ship Mode' (implying a list of values).
- Users might drag a date slider to select a specific time window.
- Users might look for items that are either 'URGENT' or 'HIGH' priority.

Constraint:
- Focus on the intent of "filtering a list".
- Vary the combination of filters randomly.
- Return ONLY the raw SQL, one per line.

Group 3: Metric Summarization (Aggregation)
Context:
You are simulating an Executive AI Assistant answering questions from the CEO. The CEO is interested in high-level KPIs and performance metrics, not individual rows.

Task:
Generate 3000 distinct SQL queries that derive statistical insights from the TPC-H data.
- The intent is to calculate totals (revenue, quantity), averages (price, discount), or counts (orders, suppliers).
- Some questions focus on the whole company, while others break it down by region or segment.

Constraint:
- Focus on the intent of "summarizing performance".
- Return ONLY the raw SQL, one per line.

Group 4: Supply Chain Tracing (Complex Joins)
Context:
You are simulating a Supply Chain Diagnostic Agent. The agent is tasked with tracing relationships between disconnected entities (e.g., linking a Supplier to the Customers who bought their parts).

Task:
Generate 3000 distinct SQL queries that traverse the relationships in the TPC-H schema.
- The intent is to connect distant tables (e.g., Customer <-> Supplier, Region <-> LineItem).
- Scenarios include finding the source of parts, checking international shipping routes, or ranking top contributors.

Constraint:
- The queries must inherently require combining data from multiple tables to answer the question.
- Return ONLY the raw SQL, one per line.


Group 5: Operational Interventions (Sandboxed Updates)
Context:
You are simulating an Operations Agent with "Dry-Run" capabilities. The agent is proposing hypothetical fixes to data errors or testing simulation scenarios.

Task:
Generate 3000 distinct SQL Data Manipulation queries.
- The intent is to modify the state to test a hypothesis (e.g., "What if we canceled these orders?") or to correct specific data errors (e.g., "Fix the phone number for this user").
- These actions target specific rows or small groups of rows.

Constraint:
- Focus on the intent of "changing the state".
- Return ONLY the raw SQL (UPDATE/INSERT/DELETE), one per line.
